##+= operator lets you add two values together and assign the resultant value to a variable. prompt is just a variable if you might get confused
prompt = "How old are you?"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' when you are finished. "

#using while True to run the loop forever
while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    if age == 'quit':
        #to break the loop
        break
    #note that int is used only for numbers. inputting letters might result to an error or wont work
    age = int(age)

    #if-elif-else chain 
    if age < 3:
        #print your message
        print("  You get in free!")
    elif age < 13:
        #print your message
        print("  Your ticket is $10.")
    else:
        #print your message
        print("  Your ticket is $15.")
